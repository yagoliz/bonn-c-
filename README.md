# Modern C++ course
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the [Modern C++ course](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/modern-cpp/).

## Compiling
To compile an example, go inside one of the directories and do the following:
``` bash
~/bonn-c++$ cd homework_2/igg_image
~/bonn-c++/homework_2/igg_image$ mkdir build && cd build
~/bonn-c++/homework_2/igg_image/build$ cmake .. && make
```

## Running
The executable is placed under the ```bin/``` directory. To run it simply:
``` bash
~/bonn-c++$ cd homework_2/igg_image/bin
~/bonn-c++/homework_2/igg_image/bin$ ./main
```
